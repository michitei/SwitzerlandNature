    <h1 id="bluewatertitle">Blue Water</h1>
    <p id="bluewaterdescription">The water in Switzerland is known for its clear and blue appearance. This is due to a combination of factors, including the glacial origin of many of the country's lakes and rivers, which results in very low levels of sediment and pollutants. Additionally, the high altitude and the surrounding mountains can cause the water to reflect more sunlight, giving it a bright blue appearance. Additionally, Switzerland has strict water protection laws which help to keep the water clean</p>
